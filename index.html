            <h2>How to Reclaim Your Focus</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">You can't eliminate technology, but you can control it. Start with small, intentional changes.</p>
            
            <ul class="solutions-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Curate Your Notifications:</strong> Go to your settings and turn off all notifications except for those from actual people (e.g., calls, texts). Disable all badges and banners for email and social media.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Create "No-Phone" Zones:</strong> Make the bedroom, the dinner table, and the bathroom screen-free areas. This helps your brain associate those places with rest and connection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use Grayscale Mode:</strong> A colorful screen is stimulating. A gray screen is boring. Make your phone less appealing by setting it to grayscale through accessibility settings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Schedule Your Distractions:</strong> Instead of checking email and social media "just for a minute," set aside specific 20-minute blocks (e.g., one at noon, one at 4 PM) to check them all at once.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Practice Single-Tasking:</strong> Close all tabs and apps not related to the one task you are currently working on. Set a timer for 45 minutes and give that single task your undivided attention.
                </li>
